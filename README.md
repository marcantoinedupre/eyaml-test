This is a test.

This is a puppet module example to use with the [Puppet as a Service guides](https://community.runabove.com/kb/en/puppet/start-puppet-master.html).

The module installs _nginx_ and runs a basic web server with a welcome page.

*Of course you should not use this module on any host you hold to*
